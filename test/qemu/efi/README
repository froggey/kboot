This is a build of OVMF revision 14854, taken from the openSUSE binary package:

  https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/Virtualization/OVMF?repository=openSUSE_13.1

The official prebuilt versions of OVMF are outdated and do not work on newer
versions of QEMU, hence why this build was used instead.

The firmware stores non-volatile settings in the ROM image itself (QEMU will
write to the ROM), therefore the EFI test scripts take a copy of the image
to prevent modifying the in-tree copy. We have multiple copies of the ROM
image, one pre-configured to boot from HD and one to boot network, for the
HD and PXE test scripts.
